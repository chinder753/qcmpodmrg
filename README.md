# An MPO-based DMRG code for Quantum Chemistry (2016)

## Basic ideas:                                        

 1. The central quantity is the three indexed operators in MPO format.

 2. Parallelization is achieved at the operator level.

## Supports:
 
 1. Ab inito DMRG with/without particle number and Sz symmetry

 2. Spin-projected DMRG with S^2 symmetry

 3. Other functionalities: model Hamiltonians via MPO & quantities for dmet (Gammapq & Ep)
