# An MPO-based DMRG code for Quantum Chemistry (2016)

Basic ideas:                                        

 1. the central quantity is the three indexed operators in MPO format.

 2. parallelization is achieved at the operator level.

Support:
 
 1. DMRG with/without particle number and Sz symmetry

 2. Spin-projected DMRG with S^2 symmetry
